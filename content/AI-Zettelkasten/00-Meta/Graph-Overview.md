**Definition**
- Summarizes the network topology of the AI-Zettelkasten vault so contributors can navigate clusters quickly.

**Key Ideas**
- Core spine flows 01-Foundations → 02-ML → 03-Deep Learning → 04-Generative AI, representing capability maturation.
- Applied domains (05) and infrastructure (06) layer laterally, feeding safety (07) and governance (08) loops.
- Sri Lanka context (09) and Future (10) act as thematic overlays referencing upstream technical notes.
- Attachments (99) stay leaf-only, referenced by content notes but never linking outward to preserve graph clarity.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Guide strategic roadmaps by showing how Sri Lanka policy work depends on infra and safety notes.
- Plan content sprints by spotting thin link density in clusters like 04-Generative-AI.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Obsidian Canvas exports shared via `99-Attachments/Diagrams`.
- Neo4j Bloom or Graphviz renders for quarterly knowledge reviews.

**Related Notes**
- [[ZK-Index]]
- [[ZK-0300 Foundation Models]]
- [[ZK-0700 Global Regulations]]

**Further Expansion**
- Generate quarterly graph snapshots highlighting emerging clusters.
- Tag bridge notes that frequently connect policy and infrastructure topics.
