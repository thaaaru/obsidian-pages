**Definition**
- Map the canonical entry points into the vault so new notes can anchor themselves quickly.

**Key Ideas**
- Group links by topic-first folders (00-10) before tagging secondary themes.
- Use progressive IDs (e.g., ZK-0203) when threading related deep-dive clusters.
- Backlinks should surface at least one prior note and one forward-looking stub.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Kick-start onboarding workshops by pointing new analysts to canonical entry clusters (Foundations → Future).
- Prioritize weekly review sessions by tracing high-risk policy or infra threads emerging in the graph.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Obsidian graph view with tag filters to visualize folder-level traffic.
- Dataview queries that surface orphan notes and stale `updated` fields.

**Further Expansion**
- Add seeds for new folders as roadmap items emerge
- Track orphan notes weekly and plug them into existing clusters
