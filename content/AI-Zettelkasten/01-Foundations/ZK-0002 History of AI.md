**Definition**
- Chronological sweep from Dartmouth 1956 through expert systems, ML resurgence, and current foundation-model era.

**Key Ideas**
- 1950s optimism rooted in symbolic search and logic programming.
- 1980s expert systems commercialized but exposed knowledge acquisition bottlenecks.
- Deep learning breakthroughs (2012) and transformer era (2017+) shifted focus to data/compute scaling.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Teach policy cohorts how previous hype cycles shaped funding decisions.
- Compare legacy expert systems with today’s AI when modernizing banking workflows.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Timeline visualizations built in Observable or Power BI.
- Digital archives (DARPA, ACM) for sourcing first-hand artifacts.

- [[ZK-0200 Deep Learning]]
- [[ZK-0300 Foundation Models]]

**Further Expansion**
- Add regional milestones relevant to South Asia
- Timeline overlay showing policy responses vs technical milestones
