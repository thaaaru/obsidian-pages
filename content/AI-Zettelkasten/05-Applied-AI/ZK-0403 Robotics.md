**Definition**
- Robotics integrates perception, planning, and control to act in the physical world.

**Key Ideas**
- Relies on sensor fusion (vision, lidar, force) for situational awareness.
- Motion planning algorithms convert goals into feasible trajectories.
- Human-robot interaction demands safety-certifiable policies.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Warehouse picking robots in Colombo logistics hubs.
- Autonomous inspection of power lines in hill country.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- ROS2 with Nav2 stack and MoveIt planners.
- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) before field deployment.

**Further Expansion**
- Assess robotics fit for Sri Lankan manufacturing and logistics
- Document regulatory approvals needed for public-space robots
