- Weather-aware recommendation engines guide fertilizer and irrigation.
- Farmer-facing chatbots need vernacular language and offline modes.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Farmer advisory hotlines that interpret soil + weather data.
- Supply-chain optimization for tea export logistics.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- IoT sensor meshes (LoRaWAN) feeding analytics lakes.
- Edge vision rigs (OpenMV, Jetson Nano) mounted on tractors.
