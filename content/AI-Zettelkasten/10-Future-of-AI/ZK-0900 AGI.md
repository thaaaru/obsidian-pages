**Definition**
- AGI refers to AI systems with broad, human-level capability across domains.

**Key Ideas**
- Debate centers on feasibility timelines and architectural requirements.
- Safety concerns include goal misalignment and uncontrollable self-improvement.
- Research probes include cognitive architectures, world models, and meta-learning.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Stress-test national security policies against AGI threat scenarios.
- Guide university research agendas on world-models and meta-learning.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Scaling-law simulators combining synthetic data + curriculum learning.
- Causal modeling frameworks (ProbLog, Pyro) exploring reasoning stacks.
