**Definition**
- Next-wave autonomous agents will self-direct goals, negotiate, and operate across networks of tools.

**Key Ideas**
- Need verifiable planning, resource accounting, and legal persona considerations.
- Coordination protocols may resemble multi-agent systems with economic incentives.
- Human-in-the-loop oversight evolves into constitutional constraint engines.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Prototype municipal service agents that negotiate resource allocations.
- Design industrial swarms coordinating port logistics.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- AutoGen / CrewAI frameworks for multi-agent coordination.
- Event-sourced memory graphs backed by RedisGraph or Neo4j.
