**Definition**
- AI accelerates scientific discovery via automated hypothesis generation, simulation, and lab automation.

**Key Ideas**
- Foundation models learn symbolic and continuous representations of scientific domains.
- Active learning loops prioritize experiments that maximize information gain.
- Open science principles ensure reproducibility and equitable access.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Accelerate climate-resilient crop research in Sri Lankan labs.
- Assist materials discovery for energy storage initiatives.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Self-driving lab platforms (Emerald Cloud Lab, Nvidia Omniverse).
- Symbolic regression + graph neural networks for hypothesis engines.
