**Definition**
- Bio-AI interfaces explore reciprocal links between biological systems (wet labs, neuromorphic tissue, organoids) and AI models to accelerate discovery, sensing, or control.

**Key Ideas**
- Organoid intelligence and neuromorphic chips provide energy-efficient substrates that can co-train with deep nets.
- Closed-loop lab automation pairs AI planners with robotic experimentation, shortening hypothesis cycles for biotech and agriculture.
- Ethical governance must address biosecurity, data provenance, and equitable access to bio-compute resources.

**Real-World Use Cases**
- Accelerate malaria drug screening by coupling self-driving labs with generative chemistry models tuned for tropical diseases.
- Deploy biosensor networks in Sri Lankan farms where AI agents interpret soil microbiome signals in real time.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Self-driving lab platforms (Emerald Cloud Lab, Strateos) exposing programmatic APIs to reinforcement-learning planners.
- Neuromorphic hardware (Intel Loihi, BrainChip Akida) and organoid co-processors orchestrated via PyNN or Lava frameworks.

**Further Expansion**
- Partner with Sri Lankan medical schools to pilot organoid-intelligence experiments.
- Define biosafety clearances and export controls for AI-driven lab automation.
