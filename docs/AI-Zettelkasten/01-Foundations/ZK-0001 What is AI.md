**Definition**
- Artificial Intelligence is the computer science discipline focused on building systems that perceive, reason, and act with goal-directed autonomy.

**Key Ideas**
- Combines perception, knowledge, decision making, and learning loops into one pipeline.
- Historically oscillates between symbolic reasoning and statistical learning paradigms.
- Modern AI stacks treat data, models, and evaluation as co-evolving assets.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Frame smart agriculture pilots that blend sensing, prediction, and automated advisories.
- Explain AI remit vs rule-based automation to procurement teams issuing tenders.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Python ecosystems (NumPy, PyTorch) for rapid prototyping.
- Cloud AI services (Vertex, Azure AI) providing managed inference endpoints.
