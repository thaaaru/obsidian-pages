**Definition**
- AI winters are funding and interest downturns triggered by overpromised capabilities or hardware limits.

**Key Ideas**
- First winter (1974-80) tied to limited compute and ALPAC translation critique.
- Second winter (late 1980s) followed LISP machine collapse and expert system maintenance costs.
- Modern guardrails emphasize measurable milestones and incremental deployment to avoid repeat busts.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Develop investment risk memos for national AI funds.
- Design KPIs that prevent ministries from overcommitting to unproven pilots.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Scenario-planning spreadsheets modeling funding vs compute availability.
- Data portals tracking GPU pricing and VC flows.
