**Definition**
- Compares knowledge-engineered symbolic systems with data-driven statistical learning approaches.

**Key Ideas**
- Symbolic AI excels at explicit rules, interpretability, and reasoning chains.
- Statistical AI learns patterns from data, offering robustness but weaker transparency.
- Hybrid neuro-symbolic pipelines seek structured reasoning atop learned representations.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Choose hybrid reasoning stack for digital court assistants requiring traceable logic.
- Integrate symbolic constraints into credit scoring to satisfy regulatory audits.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Knowledge graph engines (Neo4j, RDF stores) alongside PyTorch models.
- Neuro-symbolic toolkits such as DeepProbLog or LNN.

**Further Expansion**
- Profile active neuro-symbolic research groups
- Map Sri Lankan use cases needing symbolic guarantees (e.g., legal drafting)
