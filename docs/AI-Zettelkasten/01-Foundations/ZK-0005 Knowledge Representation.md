**Definition**
- Knowledge representation encodes real-world facts into structures machines can reason over.

**Key Ideas**
- Includes logic, semantic networks, ontologies, and vector embeddings as complementary views.
- Trade-offs revolve around expressiveness, computational tractability, and update cost.
- Modern RAG stacks blend symbolic schemas with dense representations for grounding.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Model national health terminology so hospital RAG systems stay grounded.
- Build shared vocabularies for agricultural extension chatbots.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Ontology editors (Protégé) and SHACL validators.
- Embedding toolchains (SentenceTransformers, OpenAI text-embedding models).

**Further Expansion**
- Design ontology template for Sri Lankan civic datasets
- Document governance for embedding refresh cadence
