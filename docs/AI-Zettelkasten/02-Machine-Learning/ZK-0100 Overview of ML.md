**Definition**
- Machine Learning teaches models to map inputs to outputs using statistical inference instead of manual rules.

**Key Ideas**
- Core branches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Pipeline stages include data prep, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Success depends on aligning objective functions with measurable business outcomes.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Scope predictive maintenance for rail networks using sensor feeds.
- Design citizen feedback triage models for local councils.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Scikit-learn pipelines orchestrated via Kedro or Prefect.
- Feature stores like Feast for consistent training/inference parity.
