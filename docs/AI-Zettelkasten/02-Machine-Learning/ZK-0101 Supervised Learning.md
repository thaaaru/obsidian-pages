**Definition**
- Supervised learning fits labeled examples to approximate a function from inputs to outputs.

**Key Ideas**
- Common tasks: classification, regression, sequence labeling.
- Requires high-quality labeled data; label noise directly impacts generalization.
- Loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE) encode task-specific optimization goals.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Classify land-use from satellite imagery for zoning approvals.
- Flag fraudulent mobile-money transactions in microfinance apps.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Labeling platforms (Label Studio, Snorkel) with Sinhala/Tamil support.
- AutoML suites (AutoGluon, H2O) for baseline benchmarking.

**Further Expansion**
- Document annotation pipelines for Sinhala/Tamil datasets
- Compare manual vs weakly supervised labeling economics
