**Definition**
- Unsupervised learning discovers structure in unlabeled data through clustering, dimensionality reduction, or generative modeling.

**Key Ideas**
- Used for exploratory analysis, anomaly detection, and pretraining representations.
- Algorithms include k-means, Gaussian mixtures, PCA, autoencoders.
- Quality judged via intrinsic metrics (silhouette) or downstream performance.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Cluster tourism behavior to tailor marketing campaigns.
- Detect anomalous energy consumption patterns in the grid.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Dimensionality tools (UMAP, t-SNE) for visual analytics dashboards.
- Spark MLlib or RAPIDS cuML for large-scale clustering.
