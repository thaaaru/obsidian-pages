**Definition**
- Reinforcement learning trains agents to act in environments using reward feedback over time.

**Key Ideas**
- Formulated as Markov decision processes with policies optimized via value-based or policy-gradient methods.
- Exploration vs exploitation balance dictates sample efficiency.
- Hybrid RLHF setups blend human preference signals with RL fine-tuning.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Optimize bus dispatch scheduling with dynamic passenger data.
- Control warehouse robots navigating narrow aisles.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Simulation suites (SUMO, AnyLogic) for environment modeling.
- RL frameworks such as RLlib or Stable Baselines3.
