**Definition**
- Deep learning stacks multiple neural network layers to learn hierarchical representations from data.

**Key Ideas**
- Backpropagation enables end-to-end differentiation through layered architectures.
- GPU/TPU acceleration and large datasets unlock scaling laws.
- Regularization (dropout, norm layers) stabilizes optimization.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Automate customs inspections by fusing vision and text.
- Predict hydrological events using multi-sensor time series.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- PyTorch Lightning / DeepSpeed for large-scale training.
- NVIDIA CUDA + cuDNN stacks on DGX or cloud GPUs.
