**Definition**
- Foundation models are large pre-trained networks adaptable to many downstream tasks via fine-tuning or prompting.

**Key Ideas**
- Depend on massive datasets, heterogeneous modalities, and curated alignment steps.
- Serve as shared backbone across teams, reducing bespoke model duplication.
- Risk concentration demands governance around data provenance and access.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Deploy a shared LLM service for all ministries with policy-tuned prompts.
- Accelerate startup prototypes via instruction-tuned base models.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Model hubs (Hugging Face, MosaicML) hosting checkpoints.
- Parameter-efficient tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA).

**Further Expansion**
- Inventory foundation models viable for Sinhala/Tamil coverage
- Define evaluation harness for foundation-model adoption in ministries
