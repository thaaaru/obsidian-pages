**Definition**
- Diffusion models synthesize data by reversing a noise-adding process through learned denoising steps.

**Key Ideas**
- Deliver state-of-the-art image fidelity and controllability.
- Conditioning channels (text, sketches) steer generation.
- Inference acceleration via fewer timesteps or distilled student models.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Generate conservation visuals for heritage restoration proposals.
- Produce localized creative assets for tourism campaigns.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Stable Diffusion variants fine-tuned via DreamBooth or LoRA.
- GPU-accelerated inference servers using TensorRT or OpenVINO.
