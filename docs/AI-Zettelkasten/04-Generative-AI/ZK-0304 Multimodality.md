**Definition**
- Multimodal AI fuses signals from text, vision, audio, and structured data into unified representations.

**Key Ideas**
- Requires shared embedding spaces or cross-attention bridges.
- Enables grounding language in sensory evidence, reducing hallucinations.
- Demands balanced datasets to avoid mode collapse or modality bias.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Assist doctors by pairing radiology images with textual summaries.
- Enable disaster dashboards that mix satellite, sensor, and chat updates.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- CLIP/BLIP-style encoders for cross-modal grounding.
- Multimodal routing frameworks like LLaVA or Kosmos.

**Further Expansion**
- Map local datasets that can unlock multimodal copilots
- Experiment with low-resource multimodal tokenizers for Sinhala/Tamil
