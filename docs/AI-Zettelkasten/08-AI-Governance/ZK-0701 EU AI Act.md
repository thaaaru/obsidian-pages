**Definition**
- The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk and mandates obligations ranging from transparency to prohibitions.

**Key Ideas**
- Defines unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal-risk categories.
- High-risk systems need conformity assessments, logging, and human oversight.
- Foundation models face disclosure and safety testing requirements.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Assess whether local biometric systems fall into high-risk categories.
- Prepare conformity assessment dossiers for export-ready AI products.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- Requirement-tracking tools like Jama or Aha!.
- Model cards + risk documentation generated via Holistic AI or Monitaur.
