**Definition**
- Identifies infrastructure gaps that constrain AI deployment across Sri Lanka.

**Key Ideas**
- Limited GPU access and data center capacity outside Colombo.
- Connectivity and power stability vary by region, affecting edge AI.
- Workforce pipeline shortages in ML engineering and data stewardship.



**Real-World Use Cases**
- Inform public-private partnerships when planning regional data centers.
- Target reskilling grants to districts lacking AI engineers.

**Technologies & Tooling**
- GIS dashboards (ArcGIS, Kepler.gl) overlaying connectivity + compute.
- Talent marketplaces (LinkedIn Talent Insights) tracking skills supply.

**Related Notes**
- [[ZK-0500 GPU & Compute]]
- [[ZK-0704 Sri Lanka Policy Needs]]
- [[ZK-0904 AI+Science]]

**Further Expansion**
- Propose national compute-sharing consortium
- Develop regional AI training programs with industry partners
